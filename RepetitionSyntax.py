#A pattern followed by meta-character * is repeated zero or more times
#Replace the * with + and the pattern must appear at-least once.
#using ? means the pattern appears zero or one time.
#For a specific number of occurrences,use {m} after the pattern where m is replaced with the number of times the pattern should repeat
# use {m,n} where m is the minimum no of repetitions of n and the  maximium.Leaving out ({m,}) means the value appears at-least m times ,with  no maximium
